# Dice-Roll
In this two-player game, you roll a dice, and the number rolled is added to your current score. You can choose to "hold," which adds your current score to your total and passes the turn to the other player. However, if you roll a 1, your current score resets to zero. The goal is to reach the highest total score first.
